PVE Panel is open source under the **MIT License**.

**Copyright © 2026 Sebastian Flint**

## What the MIT License allows

| You may | Condition | No guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| use it privately and commercially | keep the copyright notice and the license text in every copy or substantial part | the software comes **as is**, without any warranty |
| change it and build on it | | the authors are not liable for damages |
| share and sell it, also as part of closed-source products or services | | |

Running PVE Panel for your customers, changing it for your own environment or building
a product on it is all allowed. You don't have to publish your changes (but pull
requests are welcome).

Because PVE Panel controls servers, networks and access, read
[Security model](../security/security-model) and test customer isolation before using it
in production. The license's "no warranty" clause applies in full.

## The license text

The binding text is the [LICENSE](https://github.com/sebastianflint/pve-panel/blob/main/LICENSE)
file in the repository:

## Third-party components

PVE Panel builds on open-source libraries, which keep their own licenses. Their
license files are included in `node_modules` and therefore in the Docker image.

| Component | Used for | License |
|---|---|---|
| Fastify and its plugins (cookie, jwt, rate-limit, static, websocket) | web servers | MIT |
| noVNC | browser console | MPL-2.0 |
| SimpleWebAuthn | passkeys | MIT |
| openid-client | single sign-on (OIDC) | MIT |
| Nodemailer | email | MIT-0 |
| undici, ws | Proxmox API, console proxy | MIT |
| bcryptjs, qrcode | passwords, 2FA QR codes | MIT |
| dotenv | `.env` file | BSD-2-Clause |
| Node.js (Docker image) | runtime | MIT, with bundled components under their own licenses |

All other packages they depend on use MIT, ISC, BSD, Apache-2.0, BlueOak-1.0.0, 0BSD
or similar permissive licenses.

noVNC is served unchanged from its package. MPL-2.0 only requires that changes to
noVNC's own files be published under MPL-2.0; it doesn't affect the rest of the panel.

The fonts (Instrument Sans, JetBrains Mono) are loaded from Google Fonts and are under
the SIL Open Font License; they are not part of the repository.
