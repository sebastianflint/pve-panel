The **Activity** tab in the admin interface records the exact reason of most failures
(sign-ins, provisioning, deletions). Check it first.

## Guest agent errors

**"qga command 'guest-exec-status' failed - got timeout":** the guest agent in a
server didn't answer for a moment, which happens while the server is busy
(installers, heavy disk activity, Windows setup). The panel waits such stalls out
and only gives up after `AGENT_UNRESPONSIVE_SECONDS` (default 180) of silence. If
it does give up, check the server's load and that `qemu-guest-agent` is running,
then try again. Updating the agent (virtio-win ISO on Windows) helps with
recurring stalls.

**"Agent error: PID lld does not exist":** the guest agent reports a finished
command only once; if that answer arrived late, the agent has already forgotten the
process ("lld" is a formatting bug in the Windows agent's message). The command
did run. The panel now handles this: commands that are safe to repeat are run once
more, and one-shot steps (`tailscale up`, `tailscale logout`) are never repeated;
instead the panel checks whether Tailscale is really connected or disconnected.
