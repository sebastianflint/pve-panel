## Overview

**PVE Panel** turns a Proxmox VE environment into a lightweight self-service platform.

Users receive a dedicated portal where they can manage assigned servers, open consoles, view usage data, work with snapshots, and — when enabled — provision new systems from administrator-approved templates.

Administrators retain control over templates, quotas, ownership, networking, authentication, and lifecycle operations.

The browser **never communicates directly with Proxmox VE** and never receives the Proxmox API token.

```

The customer and administration portals run as **separate web servers** in the same process. They use separate session cookies and signing keys, and the customer-facing server does not expose administrator routes.

## 🤖 AI-assisted development

PVE Panel was built with substantial help from an AI assistant (**Claude by Anthropic**). To be transparent about what that means:

**Created with AI assistance**

- most of the source code (backend, customer and admin portals, scripts)
- the Docker, Compose and GitHub Actions setup
- the documentation, the README and the [documentation website](https://sebastianflint.github.io/pve-panel/)
- automated tests during development, largely against simulated Proxmox, guest-agent, SMTP and WireGuard environments and a certified test OpenID provider
- the screenshots, taken from such a test environment with sample data

**Done by the maintainer**

- defining the requirements and deciding on features and design
- running and testing the panel against a real Proxmox VE environment and reporting problems, which were then fixed
- publishing, versioning and operating the project

**What this means for you**

- Not every feature has been tested in every real-world combination — especially provider-specific setups (OIDC providers, mail servers, NAS models, Windows editions).
- AI-generated code can contain mistakes, including security-relevant ones. Review the code and the [security model](#️-security-model) before using PVE Panel in production, and validate customer isolation yourself (see [Recommended validation](#-recommended-validation)).
- Issues and pull requests are reviewed and handled by the maintainer.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

PVE Panel deliberately separates the customer-facing application from Proxmox VE.

```text

        ┌───────────────┐
        │ Proxmox VE    │
        └───────────────┘
```

Every server-specific request is checked against the internal ownership database before PVE Panel contacts Proxmox.

A resource that does not belong to the signed-in customer is returned as **404**, just like a resource that does not exist.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Proxmox VE 8 or 9
- Node.js **22.13+** for a native installation
- or Docker / Docker Compose (also Portainer or a NAS Docker app)
- A dedicated Proxmox API user/token
- Optional: Proxmox SDN for isolated customer networks
- Optional: QEMU Guest Agent for richer VM integration

---

## 1. Prepare Proxmox VE

Create a dedicated service account and a restricted role:

```bash
pveum user add panel@pve --comment "PVE Panel"

# Proxmox VE 9
pveum role add PanelCustomer --privs \
"VM.Audit VM.PowerMgmt VM.Console VM.Snapshot VM.Snapshot.Rollback VM.GuestAgent.Audit"

# On PVE 8 use VM.Monitor instead of VM.GuestAgent.Audit.

pveum pool add customers
pveum acl modify /pool/customers --users panel@pve --roles PanelCustomer

# Token inherits the user's permissions.
pveum user token add panel@pve panel --privsep 0
```

Store the generated token secret securely.

Add customer-managed systems to the dedicated pool:

```bash
pveum pool modify customers --vms 101,102
```

Systems outside the configured customer pool remain outside the panel's effective permission scope.

### Additional permissions for self-service provisioning

Only add these permissions when customers should be allowed to create servers:

```bash
pveum role modify PanelCustomer --append 1 \
  --privs "VM.Allocate VM.Clone VM.Config.CPU VM.Config.Memory VM.Config.Disk VM.Config.Cloudinit VM.Config.Options VM.Config.Network Datastore.AllocateSpace Datastore.Audit"

pveum role modify PanelCustomer --append 1 \
  --privs "VM.GuestAgent.Unrestricted"

pveum pool add templates
pveum pool modify templates --vms 9000,9001
pveum acl modify /pool/templates --users panel@pve --roles PanelCustomer

pveum acl modify /storage/VMStorage \
  --users panel@pve --roles PanelCustomer
```

Newly provisioned servers are automatically added to the pool defined by `PVE_POOL`.

---

## 2. Configure PVE Panel

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebastianflint/pve-panel.git
cd pve-panel

npm install
cp example.env .env
```

Configure at minimum:

```env
PVE_URL=https://pve.example.com:8006
PVE_TOKEN_ID=panel@pve!panel
PVE_TOKEN_SECRET=your-token-secret
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
```

Create the first administrator:

```bash
npm run user:create -- admin@example.com 'a-long-password' --admin
```

Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Default endpoints:

| Interface | Address | Exposure |
|---|---|---|
| Customer portal | `http://host:3000` | Customer-facing |
| Admin portal | `http://127.0.0.1:3001` | Localhost only by default |

For local HTTP testing, set:

```env
COOKIE_SECURE=false
```

> ⚠️ Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` again for production and serve the customer portal over HTTPS.

---

## 🐳 Deployment

### Docker Compose

```bash
cp example.env .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Create the first administrator inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec panel \
  npm run user:create -- admin@example.com 'a-long-password' --admin
```

Or, without a terminal, let the panel create it on first start:

```env
INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-me
```

Remove `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` after the initial account has been created.

### Prebuilt image

Published container image:

```text
ghcr.io/sebastianflint/pve-panel
```

The GitHub workflow builds `amd64` and `arm64` images from `main` and release tags, with an SBOM and signed build provenance.

For a server or NAS deployment, use one of:

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `deploy/docker-compose.yml` | Docker Compose, UGREEN Docker app (reads `.env`) |
| `deploy/docker-compose.portainer.yml` | Portainer stacks (reads the stack's variables) |

The image defaults to `ghcr.io/sebastianflint/pve-panel:latest`. To pin a release:

```env
PANEL_IMAGE=ghcr.io/sebastianflint/pve-panel:1.1
```

Then deploy:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Portainer

Paste `deploy/docker-compose.portainer.yml` into **Stacks → Add stack → Web editor** and enter the settings under **Environment variables** (or load your `.env`).

> Portainer saves stack variables to `stack.env`. The Portainer file passes them into the container with `env_file: stack.env`; with `env_file: .env` the container would start without settings.

### HTTPS with Caddy

The repository includes a `Caddyfile`.

Set:

```env
PANEL_DOMAIN=panel.example.com
PANEL_PUBLIC_URL=https://panel.example.com
COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

Then start the HTTPS profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile https up -d --build
```

Caddy handles certificate issuance and WebSocket proxying for the browser console.

### UGREEN NAS / UGOS Pro

PVE Panel can also run as a Docker project on compatible UGREEN NAS systems.

A typical deployment directory is:

```text
/volume1/docker/pve-panel
```

For a prebuilt-image deployment, place the deployment `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` in the directory and create a Docker Project in UGOS (**Docker → Project → Create**).

Add the NAS's IP to the Proxmox `management` IPSet so the panel can reach the Proxmox API.

---

## 📦 Versions & updates

The running version is stamped into the image by the release workflow — nothing to edit by hand.

- **Admin portal:** version badge in the top bar (a dot = update available) and an **About** tab with version, commit, build date, uptime and update instructions
- **Customer portal:** the version number in the sidebar and on the Account page (`SHOW_VERSION_TO_CUSTOMERS=false` hides it)
- **Update check:** asks GitHub for the latest release, at most every 6 hours (`UPDATE_CHECK=false` turns it off)

### Publishing a release

```bash
npm version patch      # 1.1.0 -> 1.1.1  (fixes)
npm version minor      # 1.1.1 -> 1.2.0  (new features)
npm version major      # 1.2.0 -> 2.0.0  (breaking changes)
git push --follow-tags
```

`npm version` raises the version in `package.json`, commits it and creates the tag. The workflow then:

1. builds the image as `1.2.0`, `1.2`, `1` and moves `latest` to it
2. creates a **GitHub Release** with generated release notes
3. refuses to build if the tag and `package.json` disagree

Pushes to `main` without a tag build development versions such as `1.2.0-dev.a1b2c3d` and publish them as `edge` — they never replace `latest`.

| Image tag | Contains | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `latest` | the newest release | normal deployments |
| `1.4` / `1` | newest release of that line | updates within a version line only |
| `1.4.0` | exactly that release | fully pinned deployments |
| `edge` | the newest development build from `main` | testing only |

### Updating a deployment

| Deployment | Update |
|---|---|
| Portainer | Stacks → your stack → **Update the stack** with *Re-pull image and redeploy* |
| UGREEN Docker app | Project → your project → redeploy |
| Command line | `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` |

Data stays in the volume; database changes are applied automatically at start.

---

## 👤 Server ownership

PVE Panel does not rely only on Proxmox permissions to determine which systems a customer can see.

Each assigned resource is tracked in the internal ownership database.

Before any per-server operation is sent to Proxmox, PVE Panel validates ownership.

```text
Request
  │
  ▼
Authenticated customer
  │
  ▼
Ownership lookup
  │
  ├── not owner ──► 404
  │
  └── owner
        │
        ▼
   Proxmox API
```

This applies to:

- status
- power operations
- snapshots
- usage data
- consoles
- deletion
- remote-access operations

---

## 🌐 Customer network isolation

PVE Panel can automatically create one private Proxmox SDN network for each customer.

Enable it with:

```env
CUSTOMER_NETWORKS=true
```

Example:

```text
Customer 1
   │
   └── cu0001 ── 10.100.1.0/24 ──┐
                                   │
Customer 2                         ├── NAT ──► Internet
   │                               │
   └── cu0002 ── 10.100.2.0/24 ──┘
```

Each network receives:

- its own SDN VNet, with the customer's name as alias (e.g. `lena (example.com)`)
- dedicated `/24` subnet
- gateway
- DHCP
- NAT
- Proxmox firewall rules
- IP filtering
- MAC filtering
- inter-customer isolation

By default, customer workloads can access the public internet while private/internal networks are blocked.

Typical blocked ranges include:

```text
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
100.64.0.0/10
169.254.0.0/16
```

This prevents customer workloads from using the Proxmox host as a route into internal networks.

### Required SDN permissions

```bash
pveum role add PanelNetwork --privs "SDN.Allocate SDN.Audit SDN.Use"
pveum acl modify /sdn --users panel@pve --roles PanelNetwork
```

Install `dnsmasq` on the Proxmox host:

```bash
apt install dnsmasq
systemctl disable --now dnsmasq
```

### Host firewall

Set these up **before** enabling the datacenter firewall:

```bash
# Keep the Proxmox UI/API reachable for your admin network and the panel host
pvesh create /cluster/firewall/ipset --name management
pvesh create /cluster/firewall/ipset/management --cidr 192.168.50.0/24

# DHCP for customer networks — no source filter (requests come from 0.0.0.0)
pvesh create /cluster/firewall/rules --type in --action ACCEPT --proto udp --dport 67 --enable 1

# Ping to the host (blocked by default)
pvesh create /cluster/firewall/rules --type in --action ACCEPT --macro Ping --enable 1
```

The panel creates and maintains the necessary customer SDN objects when provisioning is enabled.

> **Important**
>
> Customer isolation depends on the Proxmox datacenter firewall being enabled. Validate management access before enabling it remotely. Locked out? From the console: `pvesh set /cluster/firewall/options --enable 0`.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

### Local authentication

PVE Panel supports traditional username/password authentication with secure server-side controls and rate limiting. Password sign-in can be switched off per portal once SSO works.

### Two-factor authentication

TOTP-based two-factor authentication is built in.

Compatible apps include:

- 1Password
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Google Authenticator
- Authy
- other RFC 6238-compatible authenticators

Features include:

- QR-code enrollment
- recovery codes
- forced 2FA per user
- administrator reset
- one-time use protection
- encrypted TOTP secrets

Locked out yourself? `npm run user:reset-2fa -- admin@example.com`

### OpenID Connect / SSO

PVE Panel supports OpenID Connect for both the customer and administrator portals.

Designed for standards-compliant providers such as:

- Microsoft Entra ID
- Keycloak
- Authentik
- Google Workspace
- Okta

The implementation is tested against a certified OpenID provider and uses:

- Authorization Code Flow
- PKCE (`S256`)
- `state`
- `nonce`
- discovery metadata
- ID-token validation (via the OpenID-certified `openid-client`)
- Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) when the provider supports them
- optional verified-domain restrictions
- issuer + `sub` account binding

Example configuration:

```env
OIDC_ENABLED=true
OIDC_ISSUER=https://id.example.com/realms/example
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=pve-panel
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=replace-me

PANEL_PUBLIC_URL=https://panel.example.com
ADMIN_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Callback URLs:

```text
https://panel.example.com/api/auth/oidc/callback
http://localhost:3001/api/auth/oidc/callback
```

Only the panel needs to reach the provider (outbound HTTPS); the provider never connects to the panel.

> **Microsoft Entra ID** doesn't send `email_verified`: set `OIDC_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL=false` together with `OIDC_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`. Provider notes are in the [documentation](https://sebastianflint.github.io/pve-panel/docs/security/single-sign-on).

Once SSO is validated, local password login can optionally be disabled independently for each portal.

---

## ✉️ Email & invitations

Email is configured in the **admin portal → Settings**, not in `.env`:

- SMTP server, port and encryption (**TLS**, **STARTTLS** or none for an internal relay)
- username and password — the password is stored **encrypted** and never shown again
- sender name and address
- the panel address used in links
- a **Send test email** button to verify everything end to end

Once email works, **Add a customer** offers **Send an invitation email**. Instead of a password chosen by the admin, the user receives:

- the panel address and their sign-in email
- a personal link to **set their own password**
- a note when 2FA is required or single sign-on is used

```text
Admin adds user ──► Invitation email ──► User opens link ──► Sets password ──► Signs in
                                          (single-use, 3 days)
```

Invitation links:

- work **once** and expire after **3 days**
- are stored only as a SHA-256 hash
- carry the token after `#`, so it never reaches server logs or `Referer` headers
- are replaced by **Resend invitation** (the old link stops working)

The customer list shows *Invitation pending* or *Invitation expired* until the user has set a password.

> Changing `JWT_SECRET` makes the stored SMTP password unreadable — enter it again in Settings afterwards.

---

## 🪟 Windows templates

Windows systems can be deployed without cloud-init.

The repository includes:

```text
docs/windows/unattend.xml
```

Recommended template workflow:

1. Install Windows.
2. Install VirtIO drivers.
3. Install the QEMU Guest Agent.
4. Enable the QEMU Guest Agent in Proxmox.
5. Configure the desired base applications and settings.
6. Ensure the network adapter uses DHCP.
7. Copy and customize `docs/windows/unattend.xml`.
8. Run Sysprep.
9. Shut down the VM.
10. Convert it to a Proxmox template without booting it again.

Example:

```cmd
copy unattend.xml C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\unattend.xml

C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\sysprep.exe ^
  /generalize ^
  /oobe ^
  /shutdown ^
  /unattend:C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\unattend.xml
```

During provisioning PVE Panel can:

- wait for Windows setup to complete
- set the final Administrator password
- verify the password
- rename the computer
- force DHCP on network adapters
- validate that an address was received
- reboot the VM
- report provisioning failures to the customer

---

## 🐧 Linux templates

Linux provisioning uses cloud-init.

A template should contain:

- a cloud-init-compatible image
- a cloud-init drive
- DHCP networking
- optionally `qemu-guest-agent`

PVE Panel applies:

- hostname
- username/password
- SSH keys
- CPU
- memory
- network configuration
- disk expansion

---

## 🔌 Remote access

PVE Panel supports multiple ways to reach customer systems without exposing Proxmox itself.

### Browser console

Customers can launch one-time console sessions directly from the panel.

Console sessions are:

- bound to the requesting user
- single-use
- short-lived
- proxied through PVE Panel

### WireGuard VPN

An optional central WireGuard gateway can provide remote access into each customer's private network.

```text
Laptop / Phone
      │
      │ WireGuard
      ▼
Public IP : UDP 51820
      │
      ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│ WireGuard Gateway│
└─────────┬────────┘
          │
          ├── Customer 1 VPN clients → Customer 1 VNet only
          └── Customer 2 VPN clients → Customer 2 VNet only
```

Customers can:

- add VPN devices
- download configuration files
- scan QR codes
- see connection state
- remove devices

Private keys are shown once and are not retained by the panel.

The gateway is prepared once with `docs/vpn/setup-gateway.sh` — see the [documentation](https://sebastianflint.github.io/pve-panel/docs/networking/wireguard-vpn) for the routing and port-forward steps.

### Tailscale

When enabled, customers can connect individual servers to their own Tailscale account.

Supported modes:

- **Single server** — expose only that server through the customer's tailnet
- **Private-network gateway** — advertise the customer's private subnet through a Linux VM

PVE Panel installs and configures Tailscale through the QEMU Guest Agent.

The customer's Tailscale account itself is never managed by the panel.

---

## 🛡️ Security model

PVE Panel was designed so that giving customers self-service access does **not** mean giving them Proxmox access.

Key controls include:

- Dedicated Proxmox service account
- Restrictive custom Proxmox roles
- Resource pool scoping
- Application-level ownership validation
- Separate customer and admin HTTP servers
- Separate customer/admin sessions
- Admin interface bound to localhost by default
- `httpOnly` session cookies
- `SameSite=Strict`
- Rate limiting
- Short-lived, user-bound console tickets
- User-bound task tracking
- Audit logging
- Optional TOTP 2FA
- OIDC with PKCE and token validation
- Customer-specific SDN isolation
- VM firewall enforcement (incoming and outgoing)
- IP and MAC filtering
- Restricted VPN routing
- Proxmox API token kept server-side
- No secrets in the container image

### TLS to Proxmox

For production deployments, use a trusted Proxmox certificate or provide the Proxmox CA:

```env
PVE_CA_FILE=/app/certs/pve-root-ca.pem
```

Avoid:

```env
PVE_VERIFY_TLS=false
```

outside development environments.

---

## 🔒 Admin interface

The administrator portal listens on localhost by default:

```text
127.0.0.1:3001
```

Access it securely through SSH:

```bash
ssh -L 3001:127.0.0.1:3001 you@panel-host
```

Then browse to:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

If the admin interface is exposed on another interface, protect it with network-level access controls.

## 🔁 Reverse proxy

The customer portal can be placed behind an existing reverse proxy.

WebSocket upgrades are required for the integrated console.

Example NGINX configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name panel.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 1h;
    }
}
```

## 📦 Backups

The application database lives in the persistent Docker volume.

Create a consistent backup:

```bash
docker compose exec panel npm run db:backup
```

Copy backups from the container:

```bash
docker compose cp panel:/app/data/backups ./backups
```

---

## 🧰 Useful CLI commands

Create an administrator:

```bash
npm run user:create -- admin@example.com 'a-long-password' --admin
```

Create a customer (optionally requiring 2FA):

```bash
npm run user:create -- customer@example.com 'another-long-password' --require-2fa
```

Assign an existing VM or container:

```bash
npm run vm:assign -- 101 customer@example.com "Web server"
```

Reset 2FA:

```bash
npm run user:reset-2fa -- admin@example.com
```

Backup the database:

```bash
npm run db:backup
```

---

## 🔧 Branding

Change the product name through `.env`:

```env
PANEL_NAME=PVE Panel
```

The configured name is used on:

- sign-in pages
- navigation
- browser titles
- customer portal
- administrator portal
- the authenticator app entry for 2FA

### Own OS icons

Windows and Linux servers are shown with neutral built-in glyphs. To use your own icons, place any of these files in the branding folder:

```text
os-windows.svg   os-linux.svg     (or .png / .webp)
```

The folder is `BRANDING_DIR` (default `data/branding/` next to the database). With Docker, mount it:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./branding:/app/branding:ro
```

```env
BRANDING_DIR=/app/branding
```

Only these file names are served, with a strict sandbox policy. Make sure you're allowed to use the images you add.

## ⚙️ How provisioning works

```text
1. Customer selects template and sizing
                 │
                 ▼
2. Quotas and permissions are validated
                 │
                 ▼
3. A free VMID is reserved
                 │
                 ▼
4. Full clone is created
                 │
                 ▼
5. CPU / RAM / disk / network are configured
                 │
                 ▼
6. Guest-specific setup runs
      ┌──────────┴──────────┐
      │                     │
      ▼                     ▼
 Linux / cloud-init     Windows / QGA
      │                     │
      └──────────┬──────────┘
                 ▼
7. Readiness is verified
                 │
                 ▼
8. Server becomes available to the customer
```

Only one provisioning job per customer can run at a time.

### Reinstall

Customers can start a self-created server fresh from any offered template that fits its disk:

- everything on the disk is erased, **including all snapshots** (and a Tailscale connection)
- name, VM ID, size and **MAC address** stay — so DHCP usually hands out the same IP
- the server stays in the customer's private network; isolation rules are re-applied
- new sign-in details are chosen like at creation; Windows ⇄ Linux switches are possible
- confirmed by typing the server name; a failed reinstall can simply be retried

Servers assigned by an administrator cannot be reinstalled by customers.

### Resize

Customers can change the size of self-created servers within their plan:

| Resource | How it changes |
|---|---|
| CPU cores, memory | Saved immediately; a running server uses them after a **restart from the panel** (optional right away) |
| Disk | **Grow only**, applied immediately — Linux cloud images expand at the next boot, Windows drive `C:` is extended by the panel |

- the plan check counts **pending** changes too, so resizing several running servers can't exceed the plan
- the server page shows *Size change waiting for a restart* until the change is active
- Windows needs at least 2 GB of memory; disks can never shrink

If provisioning fails, the customer receives a visible failure state instead of a permanently spinning setup process.

---

## 🧪 Recommended validation

Before giving users access, validate the deployment with at least two test customers.

Confirm that:

- Customer A cannot see Customer B's servers
- Customer A cannot access Customer B's network
- Customer workloads cannot access internal management networks
- Public internet access works where intended
- Browser consoles are customer-bound
- VPN devices can reach only their assigned customer network
- Admin port `3001` is not publicly reachable
- OIDC and 2FA behave as expected
- Proxmox API permissions are limited to the intended resources

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Potential future improvements include:

- Cross-node placement
- Integrated backup management
- Customer-managed firewall rules
- Additional lifecycle automation
- PostgreSQL support for multi-instance deployments
- More quota and billing-oriented functionality

Contributions and ideas are welcome through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

A typical workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebastianflint/pve-panel.git
cd pve-panel
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

After making and testing your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

Then open a Pull Request.

For larger changes, consider opening an Issue first so the design can be discussed before implementation.

---

## 🐛 Issues & feature requests

Found a bug or have an idea?

Use the repository issue tracker:

**https://github.com/sebastianflint/pve-panel/issues**

When reporting a problem, useful information includes:

- Proxmox VE version
- deployment method
- PVE Panel version / commit (admin portal → About)
- browser
- relevant container/application logs
- the reason shown in the Activity tab, if any
- exact error message
- steps to reproduce

Never include API tokens, passwords, OIDC secrets or other credentials in an issue.

---

## ⚠️ Project status

PVE Panel directly controls virtualization, networking, guest provisioning and remote-access functionality.

Large parts of the project were written with AI assistance (see [AI-assisted development](#-ai-assisted-development)).

Before using it in a production or internet-facing environment:

- review the code
- review Proxmox permissions
- test customer isolation
- use TLS
- protect the admin interface
- back up the database
- validate firewall rules
- keep Proxmox, Node.js and dependencies up to date

### Built for self-service Proxmox environments

Give customers the controls they need — while keeping the hypervisor, credentials and other customers out of reach.
